# MIPS-HexConverter
A python script that converts MIPS instructions into their hexadecimal or from Hexadecimal to MIPS, with handling for invalid instructions. 
To use, simply run the script from the commandline, with the arguments "-a *some MIPS command*" to convert from MIPS to hex. Or "-m *Some hex string*" to convert from hex to MIPS. 
To ensure that there are no errors within the dollars signs for the registers, use single quotes when inputing the MIPS string.
